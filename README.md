# Interactive Presentation App

Have you ever been embarrased to ask a question in class? We have created Clarify, an interactive presentation web app for students to ask anonymous questions during a lecture.

<h3> About </h3>
  
The professor will upload a presentation and display it to the class. Students will be ale to log in and pull up the same presentation on thier laptops. As the professor walks through their presentation, students can independently view slides and post questions to specific slides. These questions appear anonymously to the professor, who can opt to resolve, dismiss or postpone the question. Other students can upvote questions, so the professor knows what is most pressing.
